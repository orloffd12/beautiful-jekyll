Study: https://www.mdpi.com/2571-905X/2/3/25/htm 
→ Computing Happiness from Textual Data 


1. Identify a statistical question that you could ask.  
Are people living in urban, suburban, or rural areas happier?   
2. Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the   population would help answer your question?  
The population of New York State  
After computing the happiness of all of the people in my sample frame, I will be able to determine   what setting is best for achieving the most amount of happiness within a general population.   
3. Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.  
New York County (Urban), Suffolk County (Suburban LI), and Greene County (Upstate NY)  
I am choosing these three counties because I am able to compare three drastically different   counties. I believe that they accurately represent urban, suburban, and rural environments in New   York State.
4. Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?  
The sampling method I would use for this study would be Stratified Sampling. This is due to the   fact that the groups would be internally homogenous (all living in a similar type of environment   within each group) but externally heterogeneous because they would all live in different types of   environments externally. 
5. Suppose you had the means to run an experiment on this sample. Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.  
The null hypothesis would be that there is no correlation between happiness and the type of area   that people live in. 
The alternative hypothesis is that living in suburban areas creates the most utility among people,   followed closely by urban and rural being the least desirable for being happy.   
6. Identify the variables and treatments that would provide information about your question.   Explain your choice of treatments.
The independent variable is the type of area that people are living in.   
The dependent variable is the overall level of happiness in each area after accounting for   differences in population. 
The treatments would be the different happiness in each county.   
7. Identify the treatment groups, and how each subject would be assigned to a group.  
The treatment groups are the people being surveyed on their level of happiness.   
8. Briefly discuss how the experiment would be conducted.  
The experiment would start with me identifying a group of 10,000 people from each different county   that I am testing. I am doing a group of 10,000 because I feel that it effectively (but not entirely) accounts for the differences within each group. After identifying the sample, I   would use the textual Data I am provided with from surveying all 30,000 people to compare overall   levels of happiness within each group. I will then be able to see my results.
9. What biases may come up, and how would you address them?  
Some biases that may come up can be differences in income. I believe that I can account for this   by taking a large number of people from each different group. I can also ensure that I survey   people from low-income neighborhoods and middle-class neighborhoods in order to account for this.   
Something that may be considered a bias that may come up during this experiment is that different   people have different ideas of what “happiness” is. I can resolve this by asking  questions in the surveys that do not directly ask people if they are happy but instead ask them to   rank their feelings about certain aspects of their lives.
