*Which dataset did you work with?    

I worked with the country vaccinations dataset. This dataset contained a lot of up-to-date information   about the current state of vaccinations in a plethora of countries.   

*Analysis and conclusion:   

I decided that I wanted to focus on the relationship between Israel, France, the UK, and Canada in terms  
of the daily vaccinations per million people. Due to the differences in size, region, and location of   these countries I thought that it would be interesting to show how quickly these countries can distribute   vaccines. By looking at daily vaccinations per million, I am eliminating the discrepancies   between the populations of each country. When running my code, I saw that Israel had ten times more daily   vaccinations than Canada and France, and it also held a strong lead on the United Kingdom (the UK   had ¼ as many daily vaccinations per million people as Israel). Some reasons for this may be the   extremely small size of Israel: if Israel obtains the vaccines, it is extremely easy for them to   distribute them to even the most remote areas of the country. Canada had the same number of daily   vaccinations per million people as France. This surprised me since Canada seems like it’s a logistical   nightmare due to its extremely large size and general northern location. The discrepancy between France   and the United Kingdom may be due to the fact that the UK isn’t a part of the EU anymore.   

As the number of data collected grew larger for each country, the standard deviation increased. From   lowest to highest, the standard deviation was France, Canada, UK, and then Israel. Israel had the lowest   coefficient of variation (SD/mean) and the rest of the countries had CV’s lower than one, meaning that   there was a relatively low variation. Israel was the only country in which the data skewed right since the   median was greater than the mean, which may signify that a larger number of daily vaccinations per   million could cause the data to skew in different directions. The difference between the minimum and the   maximum also increased as the number of daily vaccinations per million increased: the greater the sample,   the higher the variability. To conclude, this dataset showed me a relationship between daily   vaccination rates and countries that I would not have been able to decipher without it.
