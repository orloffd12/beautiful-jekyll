**1. Find a scientific study / research paper of your choice.*    
[Eviction Lab](https://evictionlab.org/)  
[Csv File I Analyzed](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/get-the-data/)  
  
**2. Write a blog post that covers the following topics:**   
  
* Analyze and question the data that the scientists use.    
The goal of this study is to provide data for the general population on how eviction   filings have increased or decreased in specific areas since the beginning of the   pandemic. To analyze the data, I looked at Boston’s dataset (although there were about   15 others that were available). The scientists used court records in order to determine the number of eviction filings that were in each specific region and they separated the filings by using neighborhood demographics. However, while looking at the data, the overwhelming majority of eviction filings that this dataset took into consideration were from neighborhoods that were categorized as having a majority of white demographics. In addition, the largest portion of racial / ethnic groups were categorized as “Other” which is vague and doesn’t give us enough information if we want to be as accurate as possible. The scientists collected data on a weekly basis although they reported it on a monthly basis. This most likely increased the accuracy of the data as the scientists were able to focus more on each specific week and have a lower probability of missing any filings. Furthermore, something that I would like to see in this dataset is not only by a separation of racial or ethnic majority, but also a separation by median/average income in each neighborhood that the evictions were filed. This would be extremely helpful as we will be able to see another correlation between specific demographics and eviction rates. 

* Analyze their results. Do you trust their findings? Why or why not?  
  
Personally, I trust the findings of this study to a certain extent. For example, if I wanted to know more about how eviction rates varied by month in different cities that were located in different states, this study would be helpful as it would show the effect that policies enacted by cities or states have on eviction rates. However, I do not trust the findings of this study in terms of learning about information for each specific demographic that they analyzed. The main reason being that the “Other” group is extremely vague, inaccurate, and doesn’t show which neighborhood it corresponds to on their interactive map. I also like the fact that they provided an interactive graph that showed average filings in prior years so that we can compare how the effect of the different policies mentioned earlier had on filings in each specific region. 
  
* How might "publish or perish" have affected this study?

I think that it may have affected this study in the sense that despite data having been collected, the scientists or researchers may have been pressured to publish data that was not yet fully categorized or labelled if they were in a time crunch. After this process is repeated multiple times it can substantially affect the integrity of the data as what it is supposed to study may not even be presented. Unfortunately, it can also be a long and tedious process to go back and look through records to find the correct categorizations for each piece of information that was collected.
